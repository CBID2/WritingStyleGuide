###WritingStyleGuide


A guide to writing clear, concise, and consistent technical documentation.

###Development and Release Process

Patches or pull requests are always welcome, but need to be reviewed before they are merged and eventually published.

All development occurs in the `dev` branch.

The `master` branch is always considered deployable, but is typically only published on a monthly basis. This is to maintain a controlled rollout environment and to limit confusion as to which styles and standards apply.

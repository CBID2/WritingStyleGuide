		 <varlistentry>
			<term>backtrace</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. "Backtrace" is the most common term used to refer to a stack trace (or stack backtrace), which is a report of the active stack frames (that is, function calls) at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. In contrast, the Python programming language calls its stack trace a "traceback," possibly because the stack frames are printed in the opposite order of those presented by gdb, the GNU Debugger. "Traceback" is the preferred term when referring to a Python stack trace.

There are, however, many factors that can create a bottleneck in a system.

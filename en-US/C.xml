		<varlistentry id="C-can_may">
			<term>can, may</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use "can" to describe actions or conditions that are possible. Use "may" only to describe situations where permission is being given. If either "can," "could," or "may" apply, use "can" - it is less tentative.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="C-cannot">
			<term>cannot</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct, when used in the negative form. For example, "you cannot end a sentence with a preposition." Do not use "can not." When used as an additive, use two words. For example, "you can not only end a sentence with a preposition, but you can also start a sentence with a conjunction."
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="C-CapEx_OpEx">
			<term>CapEx, OpEx</term>
			 <listitem>

				<para>
					When referring to the change directory command, use <command>cd</command>.

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="C-cgroup">
			<term>cgroup</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct (all lowercase) when referring to the kernel-based technology. This is a contraction of control group, and not a proper noun in itself; proper nouns use initial caps. This being the case, it is permissible to capitalize if used at the beginning of a sentence.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Where cgroup refers to something else, for example, a package name, file name, and so on, use a literal rendition.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>

				</para>
				 <para>
					In computer software, any symbol that requires one byte of storage. This includes all the ASCII and extended ASCII characters, including the space character. In character-based software, everything that appears on the screen, including graphics symbols, is considered to be a character. In graphics-based applications, the term character is generally reserved for letters, numbers, and punctuation.

			<term>clobber or clobbered</term>

			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Define briefly on first use.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Refers to the event where a private cloud exceeds its capacity and "bursts" into and uses public cloud resources. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when they are needed.<footnote> <para>

					</para>
					 </footnote>

		 <varlistentry id="C-comma_separated_values_CSV">
			<term>comma-separated values (CSV)</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use this in preference to "comma-delimited values" whenever possible. The initialism CSV is widely used to denote information broken up through use of commas. Often used to share data between different, but similar applications, wherein the comma is a translator of the data.
				</para>

		 <varlistentry id="C-command_button">

			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customized web pages for them. When you enter a website using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your web browser which stores it for later use. The next time you go to the same website, your browser will send the cookie to the web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page you might see a welcome page with your name on it.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The name "cookie" derives from UNIX objects called magic cookies. These are tokens that are attached to a user or program and change depending on the areas entered by the user or program. Cookies are also sometimes called "persistent cookies" because they typically stay in the browser for long periods of time.
